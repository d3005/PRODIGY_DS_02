# PRODIGY_DS_02
TASK_02:
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.
 The Titanic dataset from Kaggle is a classic dataset that contains information about passengers on the ill-fated Titanic ship. Let's dive into some key highlights and the technologies commonly used for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA):

1. **Dataset Overview**:
   - The Titanic dataset includes details of passengers such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether they survived or not.
   - It's a great dataset for practicing data analysis and building predictive models.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handle missing values: Identify and fill missing values in columns like 'Age' and 'Embarked'.
   - Remove irrelevant columns: Drop columns that don't contribute significantly to the analysis.
   - Correct data types: Ensure columns have appropriate data types (e.g., converting categorical variables to numeric).

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Explore the distribution of features: Plot histograms, box plots, and density plots to understand the distribution of variables like age, fare, and passenger class.
   - Investigate relationships: Use scatter plots or pair plots to explore correlations between features (e.g., age vs. fare).
   - Survival analysis: Compare survival rates based on features like gender, passenger class, and age group.
   - Feature engineering: Create new features (e.g., family size) to enhance predictive power.

4. **Technologies Used**:
   - **Python**: Python is the primary language for data analysis. Libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib/Seaborn are commonly used.
   - **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive notebooks allow step-by-step exploration and visualization.
   - **Data Visualization Tools**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for creating insightful charts and graphs.
   - **Statistical Methods**: Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and hypothesis testing.
   - **Machine Learning Libraries**: Scikit-learn for building predictive models.
